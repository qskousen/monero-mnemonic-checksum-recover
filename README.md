# Monero Mnemonic Checksum Recovery
Helper to regenerate the checksum word on a 25-word Monero wallet mnemonic, if you have only the first 24 words, or if you have an old-style mnemonic before the checksum word was added. Currently works only with English, both the newer and older word lists. Will auto detect which list your words are from.
